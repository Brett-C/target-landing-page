        <h2>Nicholas "Goofball" Adams</h2>
        <h4>GMFB Executive Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Nick can litterally make a dad joke out of anything off the top of his head. Although he is a ETL for target,
            his real passion is planting and selling flowers. Nick has 3 kids: Sophia, Anderson, and Issac, and a wife:
            Leeza. When Nick was a senior in college, she was also a senior.........in highschool. Before being
            ETL GM/FB Nick was ETL HR for almost 7 years! </p>

        <h2>Cody "The Boss" Davis</h2>
        <h4>Essientials Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Cody looooooves a martini. When Cody is off work, he enjoys spending time with his 2 cats: Hoagie and Poboy.
            He enjoys playing Tennis on Tuesday with Mak, and then going to trivia night where he spends way to much on
            $13 martinis. He likes to boss people around which is how he got his nickname, but it is usually all in good
            fun. Before being the Essientials TL, Cody was service and engagement TL for a little over a year!</p>

        <!-- insert section for makenzie -->
        <h2>Makenzie "Mak" Ellis</h2>
        <h4>Fulfillment Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Mak enjoys playing tennis with Cody on their off days. If they were keeping score, she would definitly be the
            one that wins all of the games. Mak is probably one of the easiest people to talk to, mostly because she
            just listens.</p>

        <!-- insert section for Maren -->
        <h2>Maren "Meredith" Parker</h2>
        <h4>Presentation Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Maren is a huge fan of cats. If you are needing to buy Maren a present literally anything with a cat on it is
            acceptable. When maren is off she enjoys going camping with her husband Dusty in their van. Maren also
            enjoys playing games less popular than Mario like Zelda. Don't make fun of Maren because she will flip you
            and throw you around dispite her size. Maren is the newest TL to 2055 and Presentation TL is her first
            assignment!</p>

        <!-- insert section for Austin -->
        <h2>Austin "Austini" Randall</h2>
        <h4> Inbound Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Austin is a huge anime fan. Austin enjoys going to the basketball court to shoot some hoops, as well as going
            to the gym frequently. Austin is the only TL in T2055 that can get grounded by one of the Team Members on
            our team. If Austin doesn't help carry a heavy load of cat litter to the front of the store for a guest, his
            mom yells at him, which is how we found out his middle name is Jacob. Before Austin was the inbound TL, he
            was in a flex role being Inbound TL and Closing TL for just under a year!</p>

        <!-- insert section for Jessica -->
        <h2> Jessica "Jess" Stull</h2>
        <h4>Starbucks Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Jessica came to us from Baton Rouge. She enjoys growing veggies and taking care of her goats. She loves her
            goats, even though they eat her plants. Jess also has lots of tattoos. No matter what
            is going on Jess will jump in and support anyone with anyting, inside or out of target. Before being Starbux
            TL, Jess was the Closing TL for a little over a year!</p>

        <!-- insert section for Brett -->
        <h2>Brett "Brett Brett" Cannon</h2>
        <h4>Food and Bev Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Brett finds a way to spend over $15 on fast food anytime he goes out for a bite. He is very consistant with
            going to the gym, going 1 time every 3 months. Some would consider me to be "Bumfounded". I am also a huge
            nerd. Don't worry if you don't laugh at my jokes, i will probably be laughing enough for the both of us.
            Before being Food and Bev TL, Brett was the Fulfilment team lead for 3 years!</p>
